# HTMLAssessment

### Description
This project required me to create a format of a webpage using HTML. The instructions along with the sample webpage helped me shape the page to the required look. When you first open the webpage, you will see some text formatted with both the bolded first word of each paragraph along with the middle paragraph being a block quote that is italicized. Next in the page, you will see a Table that shows the breakdown of a football game's scores along with the teams that played, which quarters they each individually scored points in along with the final score for each team. Next, there is a list with thumbnails of the two teams that played along with a working link to each individual team's website. Below each teams website is a list of Coaches and players for that team. Next, there is a form that allows the user to input their first name, last name, select their favorite sport from a dropdown menu. Then, the user can select from checkboxes that reference what the user has done in regards to their favorite sport (they can select Played, Watched, Bet on, Attended or Coached or any combination of those). Next their is a radio button to select which level of organization they enjoy most from their favorite sport (Professional, Amateur or College). Finally, the user can submit the form via a "Submit Query" button at the very bottom of the page.

#### Lessons Learned

This project was really fun to help me learn the basics of HTML such as proper formatting, working with attributes, paragraphs, links, images, elements, headings and forms. It was very eye opening to see the changes I made to the code to change different things on the webpage.

#### Technologies Used

Some Technologies that were used were Atom, Chrome browser, Macbook among many others. A very helpful tool I used for this project was w3schools webpage among many other forums that described the capabilities of HTML and what can all be done with HTML. Some other Technologies that were used were Github and the terminal to upload the changes to my git repository. 

#### What was fun?

I found this project very fun because there was a much smaller learning curve compared to Java. This increased my confidence with using the HTML language to create the webpage project. After this project I feel confident that I can tackle HTML projects with much more ease now. It was also fun to see how adjusting different pieces of the HTML puzzle made different things happen to my webpage and adjust it to my liking.
